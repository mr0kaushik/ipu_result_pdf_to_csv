# ipu_result_pdf_to_csv

It is python script used to convert ipu semester result PDF( .pdf ), into Excel Sheet (.xlxs)

I have used two important library to convert it
first one [camelot](https://github.com/socialcopsdev/camelot) and
other one is [XlsxWriter](https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/)

It will only parse the student data (not suject related data)

If you guys interact with any issue then feel free to raise it.

Thanks
