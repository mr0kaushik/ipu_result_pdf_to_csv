# ipu_result_pdf_to_csv

A python script used to convert ipu semester result PDF( .pdf ), into Excel Sheet (.xlxs)

I have used two important library to convert it
first one [camelot](https://github.com/socialcopsdev/camelot) and
other one is [XlsxWriter](https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/)

In order to work with camelot you also have to download it's
[dependencies](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install-deps.html)
  1. [GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/download.html)
  2. [TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
It will only parse the student data (not suject related data)

If you guys interact with any issue then feel free to raise it.

Thanks
